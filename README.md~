# VectorView

VectorView (or libupvector.so) is a Gazebo Visual Plugin that, once it's added to a visual on an iCub model, will display a vector which represents all contact forces of this link's contact sensor.

Some name rules to the plugin:
The name of the contact sensor must be "LINK_NAME_contact". For instace if you set it at the "l_hand" link, your contact sensor should be "l_hand_contact". Anyway be free to change this rule to something more intelligent. Furthermore, all the outuput data concerning the contact forces' history will be saved at the "history_ROBOT_NAME_LINK_NAME.txt" file.

This Plugin is set to use the icub-gazebo model that can be found on https://github.com/robotology-playground/icub-gazebo. Any name logic or model reference used on it is based on the given robot model.
