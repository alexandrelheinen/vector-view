# VectorView and VectorGUI#

**VectorView** (or libvectorview.so) is a *Gazebo Visual Plugin* that, once added to a `<visual>` element of *iCub model*, will display a vector which represents all contact forces of this link's contact sensor.

This plugin is set up to use the icub-gazebo model that can be found on [its official git repository] (https://github.com/robotology-playground/icub-gazebo), and copies of used models are saved on **models** folder. Those models were already set up with contact sensor as needed. Furthermore, any name logic or model reference are based on the given model standards.

**VectorGUI** (or binary vectorGUI) is an extern application that allows to spawn objects during Gazebo simulation and displays contacts informations retrieved from VectorView.

#### Some name rules to the plugin ####
The name of the contact sensor must be "LINK_NAME_contact". For instance if you set it at the "l_hand" link, your contact sensor should be "l_hand_contact". Anyway be free to change this rule to something more intelligent. Moreover, all the output data concerning the contact forces' history will be saved at the "history_ROBOT_NAME_iCub_LINK_NAME.txt" file and can be plotted and afterwards analyzed from **scilab scripts**.

## Dependencies ##

Just a list of required packages (and each one has it own dependencies):
 * Gazebo: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_from_source&cat=install with **SDFormat**
 * iCub: http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Linux:Installation_from_sources with **YARP**
 * [gazebo-yarp-plugins](https://github.com/robotology/gazebo-yarp-plugins)
 * [icub-gazebo](https://github.com/robotology-playground/icub-gazebo)
 * It should be all, however [ocra-core](https://github.com/ocra-recipes/ocra-core) and [codyco-superbuild](https://github.com/alexandrelheinen/codyco-superbuild) with [`ISIR_MODULES`](https://github.com/alexandrelheinen/codyco-superbuild#a-note-on-ocra-wbi-plugins) are also used in this project. Those are versions from my own repository where some changes were made the contact forces analysis.

 VectorView uses [DSPFilters](https://github.com/vinniefalco/DSPFilters), a collection of C++ classes for digital signal filtering, and [QCustomPlot](http://www.qcustomplot.com/), a Qt C++ widget for plotting and data visualization, but source and headers files from both projects are already included in `src` and `include` folders respectively, so VectorView has no direct dependency of those packages.

 To more information about QCustomPlot projet, look at `qcustomplot-info` folder that contains the version changelog and its general public license.

## Installation ##

To use VectorView Plugin you just need to compile it and set the [environmental variables](#useful-environment-variables) whom able Gazebo to find the libraries you just built
```
git clone https://github.com/alexandrelheinen/vector-view.git && cd vector-view
```
and compile it in `build` folder
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```
## Useful environmental variables ##

As VectorView is a Gazebo Plugin, some environment variables must be set up to assure that Gazebo client will find out all files it needs:
```
export VECTOR_VIEW=where_you_cloned_it/vector-view
export PATH=$VECTOR_VIEW/build:${PATH}
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=$VECTOR_VIEW/build:${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$VECTOR_VIEW/models:${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}
```
## Test it! ##

By running those three commands in respective order in different terminals to test the plugin (give your computer some time to process each command):
```
yarpserver
cd $VECTOR_VIEW && gazebo robot.world
ISIRWholeBodyController --sequence StageTestTasks
```

While the simulation is running, in another terminal can run
```
vectorGUI
```
to pop out the external interface. On this window the contact object name is displayed as well as the forces involved on this contact and where it has take place.

By clicking on **Spawn** button, the chosen model in the drop down menu is spawn at set Cartesian location (x, y, z).

### SHELL SCRIPT ###

To easily start the plugin, just run the shell script `run.sh` as follows. It will trigger out all application modules (maybe you should change its permission by typing `chmod +x run.sh` on your terminal), including test sequence tasks.
```
cd $VECTOR_VIEW && ./run.sh
```
The execution should be something like in the figure below
